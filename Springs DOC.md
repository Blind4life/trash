## Springs DOC
Our development can be divided into four stages, basically follows the waterfall model, At each stage of development, we introduced our current achievements to people
around us, sought advice from them, and do some improvement to our project. Figure below shows the project development flow.
Because of the cov-19 epidemic, we rarely meet offline, we use online apps such as teams and wechat to communicate.

**Sprint 1. Brain Storm/Forming prototype**(3.15-4.1)
At this sprint stage, we analyzed some of our current problems, Several creative models were proposed, such as sports recording app. But finally, we found that due to 
the cov-19 epidemic, the pace of our lives has been disrupted, so we decided to develop a app that can help people form habits which can restore people's lives to normal.
after discussion, we decided to introduce CCG mode in our app; We completed a app paper model at the end of this stage. 

**Stage Achievement:**
1. Determined the task objective.
2. Completed a app model.
3. Tasks were assigned to every teammate;
4. We show our app prototype to user and collect some feedback

User      | Feedback
--------- | -------------
Mr Lungaho| Nice idea to help people form habit
Lady Alba | It would be nice to review achievement

**Reflections:**
Through user feedback, we believe that our design is valuable, and we decided to introduce collection room in our app.

**Sprint 2. Technical development stage**(4.1-4.23)
At this stage, we start to work on develop application, we exchange learning progress and problems encountered every Monday. And this stage can be subdivided into 4 small stages。
 * Front-end prototype develop(4.1-4.11).
   We used angular to make a program prototype, which can carry out basic dynamic interaction and page jump.  
 * Database structure design completed(4.11-4.16)
   We analyzed the requests required by the front-end and completed the design of database.
 * JAVA springboot back-end design(4.16-4.26)
   According to the actual situation of our group, our team members choose to use springboot for back-end construction, and at the end of this stage, we got different parts of the software separately.

**Stage Achievement:**
1. Got a front end that can run independently.
2. Completed database design.
3. Got the program running on the server side.
4. We show our front-end to our users and collect some user experience feedback.

User      | Feedback
--------- | -------------
Mr Lungaho| Maybe it’s better to move the navigation bar to the top 
Lady Alba | Can I delete some targets that I am no longer interested in 

**Reflections:**
Based on user feedback, we adjusted the page layout and added new attributes to the database to make the function more complete.

**Sprint 3. Independent testing of different parts**(4.23-4.30)
At this sprint stage, we started independent testing of different parts of the program, we used the front end to conduct user acceptance tests at this 
stage, We have also fixed some bugs in the backend. At this stage, we and the people around us have conducted a lot of tests on the program, and 
received a lot of user experience feedback. At the end of this stage, we made some modifications to the UI of the program to improve the user experience.

**Stage Achievement:**
1. Completed the unit test of the program.
2. Optimized the UI .
3. Get a lot of user feedback data.

User      | Feedback
--------- | -------------
Mr Lungaho| Try not to use too many colors, it will distract people 
Lady Alba | Interactive animation should be added to the buttons 
Mr Ares   | Can I log out the program?

**Reflections:**
Fix some bugs, and do some improvement for app UI.
**Sprint 4. Bringing Things Together/More test**(4.30-5.7)
At this sprint stage, we have added interfaces to the front-end and back-end code to enable the front-end to send requests to the server and the back-end to read and write data to the database. 
And try to assemble the different parts of our program, and conducted more tests.
**Stage Achievement:**
1. Add an interface in the front end to request different data from the server.
2. Add an interface in the back end to interact with database.

see more details in [evaluation](https://github.com/Lexie-yw/Software-Engineering-Work/blob/main/Report%20Materials/Evaluation.md).

**Sprint 5. Bringing Things Together/More test**(5.7-)
At this stage, we summarized our work content, and planned the next work based on feedback and new ideas. The goal of this stage is to complete the document.
