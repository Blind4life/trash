   * Functional completeness 
      Our application designed to provides the following functions:
      - Recording functions. Including target's content, including title, description and other details
      - Tracking function. User can keep tracking their app-using process
      - Review function. User can review their achievement through app
      - Reward system. User can get corresponding reward by app.
   * Ease of interaction 
      we hope that our app not only function well, but also easy to use, this means, we try to simplify the user interface as much 
      as possible while maintaining the completeness of the functions, so as to make it easier for users to interact. We hope users to suggest from following aspects:
      - Pages/Button easy to find
      - Whether the page layout is reasonable 
      - Any other inconvenience about interaction
   * APP UI aesthetics
      At this part, we hope that users can give feedback on the look of our UI, including the overall style, color tone, layout etc.
   * App design logic
      We also hope that users could give us some suggestion about our app design logic, like our motivation and our strategy, Are they attractive enough, 
      or whether our strategy solves the problem we aim at. 
   * Other suggestion(Strengh/weakness)
