# introduction
## abstract
   Littleplanet is a singlepage web application that helps you form habits, we use the **CCG**(**C**ard **C**ollect **G**ame) model to combine efficiency and fun, users will receive generous rewards while constantly punching in to complete the phased goals. At the same time, our application will store your habit shaping process so that you can review to your own habit shaping process. Finally, let you successfully shaping your habits while get the experience of traveling around the world.
   
### Why(motivation)?
   You may find it quiet difficult to form a habit, just like us, according to research, forming a habit may take you about 66 days in average(see **Figure 1**), our society is full of [fragment information](http://github.com) too, it also prevent people from focuse on something that is difficult to get short-term feedback. Good habits not only allow you to focus on your career and keep you full of energy. Similarly, A growing literature demonstrates the relevance of habit-formation principles to health2.3. herein, we find the entry point of our app.

### How(Problem frame)?
   By investigating the habit forming process, we have summarized several rules of habit forming.
  1. Not linear!
   It is worth noting that according to research, this process is not linear, which means that the process of habit shaping requires incremental rewards or feedback, That is, the so-called bottleneck period will be encountered in the 60%-80% phase of building habits.
  2. Repetation-feedback model.
  Behavior shaping model that is generally accepted in the psychology academic community is called the repetition-feedback modele, follow the basic The method of the model follows a process of repeating specific behaviors or prohibiting specific behaviors as planned, and obtaining timely feedback.
  3. Times is all we need.
  According to Phillippa Lally's famouse theory, It may take 66 days in average to form a habit, but don't worry, we have enough rewards to help you stick to it.

## Project Objectives
   Our project is designed to help users form habits, By playing CCG games, our main users groups are those people who want to make changes but don't know how, or those who lack of self decipline, and we hope by using our app, users will get following skills:
  1.Form some habits(of course!)
  2.Become self-disciplined 
  3.Getting knowledge of habit forming
   Habit forming may be a long and difficult process, you may lose motivation during this process, but we are try to make this process more seperately and fun, to help you carry on.

### Higher level goals
   As we mentioned before, fragment information do great harm to our cognation and knowledge acquisition, we must admit that fragmented information is extremely addictive, The research on fragmented information hazards and its nature is a hot topic in current sociology, Fragmented information is attractive because of its small size and fast feedback speed6. By develop this app, we are trying to introduce these features into habit forming, this separates the long and slow-feedback habit shaping process, transform into small goals that are easy to complete and quick to feedback, of course, the realization of this goal requires us to consult more information, so that the app can provide a preset habit formation plan, or help users divide the preset goal scientifically according to the cycle of habit formation, so as to turn disadvantages of fragment information into advantages of habit forming.
